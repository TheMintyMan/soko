Tasklist

Task list:
- [x] Update how the height works in the game
- [x] Set up the grid to be 8 x 8
- [x] replace the cubes with atleast my models. Make sure they're .gltf file type
- [x] Set up directions so that we can use directions for pull
- [ ] Check for what's underneath on the next tile.
- [ ] Create a home
- [ ] Eat mechanic
- [ ] Use the tongue to pull blocks
- [ ] Current Facing Direction
- [ ] Win Condition
- [ ] Reset level 'r'
- [ ] (signals in global probs) A way for other objects to only update when a move has occured. For things like enemies and environmental conditions like wind.

 Fix List:
 - [ ] undo needs a fix now that we have to store 3 dimensions on the grid instead of just 2. Visually looks broken
